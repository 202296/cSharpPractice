# Overview

I've developed a Tic-Tac-Toe game as part of my journey as a software engineer to enhance my learning. This software allows two players to compete against each other on a virtual board, placing Xs and Os until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

My goal in creating this software was to reinforce my understanding of fundamental programming concepts like variables, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and file operations. Additionally, I aimed to implement inheritance and explore user interaction in a console-based environment.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Community Edition to develop this software. Visual Studio provides a comprehensive Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with features like code editing, debugging, and project management, which greatly aided in the development process.

For the programming language, I chose C# due to its versatility and suitability for building various types of applications, including games and utilities. C# offers a rich set of features, including strong typing, object-oriented programming capabilities, and extensive libraries, making it an excellent choice for this project.
